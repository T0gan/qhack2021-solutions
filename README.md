# Qhack2021 Solutions
This repo contains my team (Entangled_Nets) submission for the QML Challenges in [QHack 2021](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack), a quantum machine learning hackathon. We achieved perfect score (2500).

The challenges are:

> B: Quantum Gradients <br>
3. B500: Finding the Natural Gradient <br>
>> Challenge: Calculate the Fubini-Study metric and using it to find the quantum natural gradient (QNG)

> C: Circuit Training <br>
3. C500: Variational Quantum Classifier <br>
>> Challenge: Design a variational quantum classifier that can classify unknown test data from the same distribution of the given data with an accuracy of more than 95%.

> D: VQE <br>
1. D100: Optimization Orchestrator <br>
>> Challenge: Implement the classical control flow and optimization portion of the VQE to find the ground state energy of a given Hamiltonian. <br>
2. D200: Ansatz Artistry <br>
>> Challenge: Design an ansatz for a class of Hamiltonians whose n-qubit eigenstates must have the form: $|\psi(\alpha)\rangle=\alpha_{0}|10 \cdots 0\rangle+\alpha_{1}|010 \cdots 0\rangle+\cdots+\alpha_{n-2}|0 \cdots 010\rangle+\alpha_{n-1}|0 \cdots 01\rangle$ <br>
3. D500: Moving On Up <br>
>> Challenge: Implement a variational method that will find the ground state, as well as the first two excited states of the provided Hamiltonian. <br>
